## About
This was a project produced over 6 weeks as part of Facebook's Hack-a-Project programme on the theme of "Bringing Communities Together". From the prompt, we wanted to identify problems which would benefit from bringing communities together, and saw that as people progress with their education and career, they tend to become specialised in a certain area or field, and do not have as many opportunities to learn about technologies and ideas outside of it.

This is also a big problem, as it is hard to connect with experts in other fields to learn about it and discuss ideas, which we believe means there is a lot of unfulfilled potential in different areas of technology and science, due to a lack of knowledge and cross-discipline discussion, especially for niche fields.

Solved. is a platform which strives to connect people and enable them to easily discover and learn about new technologies, as well as starting discussions to express ideas and get feedback from experts in that field, encouraging inter-disciplinary collaboration.

## Dependencies

Before running the web server, run the following command in the project root to fetch all dependencies via the node package manager. Dependencies are declared in `package.json`.

```shell
npm install
```

## Run (local)

```shell
npm start
```

To view the web server, navigate to `localhost:3000`.

## Future Features and Extensibility

As this was created within a short timeframe as a proof of concept, we envision many future features and ways Solved. could be extended. These include:

* Better visualisation of technologies - implement a graph style visualisation of the links between different areas of technology to emphasize which areas may be less linked to other fields and draw attention to these, as they may have a lot of unexplored potential.
* Expert verification - allow user's credentials to be checked and displayed on their profile to give their posts more weighting in the community
